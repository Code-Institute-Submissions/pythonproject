* I kept quite close to the original plans. Although the project did grow as I started to build.

## Header and navigation bar

* There is a logo on the top left with link to home page. Visible on all screens.
* Menu resizes for small devices. Menu icon for small devices is a paw.

* On smaller devices, the text on the carousel is hidden and a menu shows underneath the carousel.
* There are links on the carousel to the relevant section of the menu.

## Register

* The register page has a simple form for a user to create a user profile.
* The side of the form gives the address and phone number of the company.
* Contains a simple form with email address, password, first name, last name and pets name.

* This page is only available to users who have created a profile and logged in.


## Login

* Also contains an option to register

## Contact

* The form has the address and phone number on the side.
* The form contains three inputs; name, email and message.
* The form uses email.js.

## About

* This page has a carousel on the centre of the page with links to all three services.
* There is also a section underneath with a little text with information on the company.

## Confirm

* This is a simple confirmation page that shows when a user books a service.

## Editbooking

* This page is similar to the booking pages except that the user can edit existing data.
* Usually, this section is only available to registered users but I have allowed it to be accessed from the link at the bottom of the page.

## Editprofile

* This is similar to the editbooking page but in this case the user can edit their profile.

## Viewbooking

* The page shows all bookings made on this site. Usually only registered users can see their own bookings but it is left open so it CRUD funtionality can be seen.

## Viewprofile

* This page allows the user view their profile and if required, the profile can be edited or deleted.

## Viewprofilebooking

* This page allows the user to view the profile associated with their registered account and if required, the profile can be edited or deleted.

## Footer

* The footer contains links to about, contact, bookings, register and login.
* The footer also contains social media icon links for Facebook & Twitter.
* The icons change depening on whether a user is logged in.
* When not logged in, the footer shows the login and register icons. When logged in, the footer shows the profile and logout icons.
* The footer also contains a copyright notice.

## Future features

* I would like to add a feature to send an email to the user when a booking is made. However, this was not requried for this project.
* I would also create a page to show all user profiles and lock both pages to admin access only.
